AutoLog helps you create clean-looking records for tracking DIY vehicle
maintenance. Records can be saved as PDF files or printed and stored in a
physical logbook.

## How to

To use AutoLog, configure any web server to serve the `index.html` file and
`images/` directory. A quick and dirty way to get up and running is to use
Python's built-in web server.

```bash
$ python -m http.server
```

Then use your browser to access your server.
